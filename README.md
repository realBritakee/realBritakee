# 👋 Hi there!
I'm a passionate gamer and coder who loves to explore the great outdoors when I'm not immersed in the digital world. Whether it's hiking through nature or crafting code, I'm always up for an adventure!

# 🚀 Projects
The Mining Dead Mod
My first major project is Britakeestudios The Mining Dead. This mod aims to enhance the gaming experience by introducing a large potion of the popular TV series The Walking Dead and it's spin-off's from AMC. I'm excited to continue working on this project and welcome any feedback or contributions.
